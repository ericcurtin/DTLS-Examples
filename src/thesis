In a financial institution, IT risk management is driven by the need to adhere to industry
and legislative regulation, hence data security is paramount. For this reason, financial
institutions should stress test for potential vulnerabilities before migrating services to the
public cloud.
This research paper focuses on one particular attack vector in cloud technology, the
Virtual Private Network (VPN). The VPN is a gateway to an institution’s private
network. Malicious exploitation of this gateway could have potentially devastating
effects on an institution’s reputation and business.
The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate a number of ways in which IPsec VPNs can
be exploited. The practical experiments detailed in this study illustrate vulnerabilities in
VPN technology, and highlight why financial institutions should adopt private cloud
instead of public cloud solutions. These experiments are performed using freely available
security tools, and are designed for use by any IT professional; not just security experts.
